Developing a bank DBMS application in Oracle SQL across 10 assignments with a team of 3, using ER modeling, schema design, normalization to 3NF/BCNF, and advanced queries. Built a Unix shell-based UI which later will be upgraded to a Java/web interface. Each phase of the project is documented in reports. Final product is going to be a fully functional, normalized DBMS application with a user-friendly interface.
